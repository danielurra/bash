## Scripting Languages vs Compiled languages
Bash executes programs directly from its source code, usually just text files<br>
these text files actually are more than just text they are commands and sentences<br>
which allow us to tell the computer what to do, we call them "source code"<br>
and this particular code is called an "scripting language" or "intepreted language"<br>
Compiled languages on the other hand can not be executed just from the source code <br>
they need to be converted to a machine language, that is called compilation<br>
## Using vi to create our first bash script

Following the tradition we're gonna create the classic "Hello World!" program<br>
we can use "echo" to print text on the screen
