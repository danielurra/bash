## Scripting Languages vs Compiled languages
Bash executes programs directly from its source code, usually just text files<br>
these text files actually are more than just text they are well known commands and sentences<br>
which allow us to tell the computer what to do, we call them "source code"<br>
and this particular code is called an "scripting language"<br>
Compiled languages on the other hand can not be executed just from the source code <br>
they need to be converted to a machine language, that is called compilation<br>
## Using vi to create our first bash script
<img src="/img/bash-hello-world-01.png" alt="bash 01"><br>
Following the tradition we're gonna create the classic "Hello World!" program<br>
We must press "i" immediately after executing vi to change to INSERT mode<br>
Once in the "insert" mode we can use "echo" to print text on the screen<br>
<img src="/img/bash-hello-world-02.png" alt="bash 02"><br>
We must use the ESC key to exit the edition mode of vi<br>
and the type "WQ!" (write and quit)<br>
<img src="/img/bash-hello-world-03.png" alt="bash 03"><br>
Let's see if our new file is there<br>
<img src="/img/bash-hello-world-04.png" alt="bash 04"><br>
Now we can run our first bash script<br>
