##Scripting Languages vs Complied languages
Bash executes programs directly from its source code, usually just text files<br>
these text files actually are more than just text they are command or sentences<br>
which allow us to tell the computer to do certain things, we call them "code"<br>
and this particular code is called an "scripting language"<br>
Complied languages on the other hand can not be executed just from the source code <br>
they need to be converted to a machine language, that is called compilation<br>
