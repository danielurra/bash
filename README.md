# bash
Bash is the default shell for both Linux and Mac<br>
How to know the version of Bash?<br>

## Scripting Languages vs Compiled languages
Bash executes programs directly from its source code, usually just text files<br>
these text files actually are more than just text they are well known commands and sentences<br>
which allow us to tell the computer what to do, we call them "source code"<br>
and this particular code is called an "scripting language"<br>
Compiled languages on the other hand can not be executed just from the source code <br>
they need to be converted to a machine language, that is called compilation<br>
## Using vi to create our first bash script
<img src="/img/bash-hello-world-01.png" alt="bash 01"><br>
Following the tradition we're gonna create the classic "Hello World!" program<br>
We must press "i" immediately after executing vi to change to INSERT mode<br>
Once in the "insert" mode we can type the command which will allow us to print text on the screen<br>
in Bash that command is "echo", see below screenshot<br>

And that's it, quite a short program, don't you think?<br>
We must use the ESC key to exit the edition mode of vi<br>
and the type "WQ!" (write and quit)<br>

Let's see if our new file is there<br>

Now we can run our first bash script<br>

## How to find all the bash (.sh) files
First let's see how many ".sh" files we do have<br>
if we have a lot of them we can narrow our search to a particular folder<br>
<img src="/img/finding-all-bash-files-word-count-how-many.png" alt="bash 05"><br>
I was right, 239 will give us a long list<br>
let's then narrow our search to the directory /etc<br>
<img src="/img/finding-bash-files-narrow.png" alt="bash 05"><br>
Only 10 that's what I was looking for<br>
Now let's list them<br>
